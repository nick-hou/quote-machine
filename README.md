## Quote Generator App

Project #1 of FreeCodeCamp's front end certification. Currently [hosted on Github Pages](https://nick-hou.github.io/quote-machine/). Practice with jQuery, SCSS, and API calls

This app just makes a single API call to type.fit (shoutout to u/SergeyWebPro) to generate an array of quotes/authors, and populates the page with a random one to start. On clicking "new quote", a random quote (and color) is picked, and populated using jQuery.
